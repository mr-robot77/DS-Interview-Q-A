Top Statistics Interview Questions:

Q1. What is Normal Distribution?

Ans.

The normal distribution is the most important probability distribution in statistics because it fits many natural phenomena.
For example, heights, blood pressure, measurement error, and IQ scores follow the normal distribution.
It is also known as the Gaussian distribution and the bell curve.

Normal distributions have the following features:
- symmetric bell shape
- mean and median and mode are equal; both located at the center of the distribution
- ≈68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean
- ≈95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean
- ≈99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean

Q2. What is Statistical Significance?

Ans.

Statistical significance is a term used by researchers to state that it is unlikely their observations could have occurred under the null hypothesis of a statistical test. Significance is usually denoted by a p-value, or probability value.

Statistical significance is arbitrary – it depends on the threshold, or alpha value, chosen by the researcher. The most common threshold is p < 0.05, which means that the data is likely to occur less than 5% of the time under the null hypothesis.

When the p-value falls below the chosen alpha value, then we say the result of the test is statistically significant.
